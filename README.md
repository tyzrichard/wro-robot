A photo log of all the progress me and my team made while creating our WRO robot.
WRO stands for World Robotics Oylmpiad, and me together with two of my classmates were really fortunate to take part! Despite being complete amateurs (I mean it, this is my FIRST time touching EV3), we took the challenge on, and yeah, here's a gallery of our progress!

I know github isn't meant to be used like this, but hey! I'm trying to get tickets for HackClub's Arcade event and I want my free Raspberry Pi.

For more context about why I built the robot as it is, check out the WRO 2024 challenge statement: https://wro-association.org/wp-content/uploads/WRO-2024-RoboMission-Senior.pdf

### Slight more(?) detailed elaborations on each of these progress logs
and no, this bit isn't made specifically for hackclub! I just like to log down my thoughts like this, its fun ngl

1. Over two seperate days, I created the mechanism to collect and stack up the blocks needed to build the houses, no motors attached.
2. Created the base of the robot with the wheels and EV3 brick and refined the collection mechanism
3. Refined the collection mechanism even more, attached the two parts together and coded it to move around and interact with blocks.
